RenderGL was an assignment in which the class learned about using OpenGL, after having
been taught vector and matrix arithmetic as well as other graphics related material. We
learned OpenGL, starting from how to draw simple shapes to the screen all the way up to
how to store objects in a scene with OOP as well as drawing them in a scene heiarchy.
For RenderGL, we were tasked with implementing most of the feature within a graphics
frameworkd provided by Depaul University.

- Scene hierarchy (order of transformations on composed objects)
- Camera manipulation to view scene.
- Projection, view, model, matrices implemented and sent to shader
- Shaders
	- Phong shading
	- Striped shading
	- Multitextured shading
		- Phong with multiple textures
		- Alpha transparency
- Putting data from read files (.rgl) into relevant Mesh Object data
